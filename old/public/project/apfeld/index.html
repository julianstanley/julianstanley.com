    <p>I began my work in the Apfeld lab in October 2015. At that time, the lab was brand new and the wet lab space had not been set up yet. I briefly worked on learning and writing tutorials related to the analysis of spacial oxidization patterns in <em>C. elegans</em>, and we&rsquo;ll come back to that in 2019.</p>

<p>I got into the wet lab in February 2016. After learning the ropes, I began investigating the relationships between different transcription factors related to aging. The idea was to cross strains that had null mutations in transcription factors known to regulate aging&ndash;such as daf-16/FOXO&ndash;and thereby create the &ldquo;shortest lived worm&rdquo;, or the smallest subset of transcription factors required to reach reproductive age. I applied for a <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/Goldwater_2016.pdf">Goldwater Scholarship {Download proposal here}</a>, which did not make it through internal sponsorship. I then applied for and won both an <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/SIRF_2016.pdf">Independent Research Fellowship {Download proposal here}</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/Provost_2016.pdf">Undergraduate Provost&rsquo;s Research Award {Download proposal here}</a> to investigate the relationship between different transcription factors. I gave <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/Presentation_July2016.pdf">lab meeting presentations {download slideset here}</a> and <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/SIRF_2016_Poster.pdf">presented a poster on my results {download here}</a>.</p>

<p>As I combined transcription factor mutants, I began wanting to investigate their tolerance to oxidative stress. The by-hand assay to assess that was very time consuming (and lacked power), which helped to lead the lab to recreating the &ldquo;lifespan machine&rdquo;. Using this automated method to measure oxidant tolerance, we were able to perform high-throughput screens for mutants that were especially tolerant of oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Out of the screen emerged a set of genes that controlled the TGFB signaling pathway in worms. So, in 2017, I again applied for a <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/Goldwater_2017.pdf">Goldwater Scholarship {Download proposal here}</a>, which again did not make it through internal sponsorship. Again, I applied for and won an <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/SIRF_2017.pdf">Independent Research Fellowship {Download proposal here}</a> to investigate the phenomenon. The relationship between the TGFB pathway and oxidant tolerance ended up being really interesting, and many parts of the project were continued and expanded on by the lab&rsquo;s first graduate student, Jodie Norris Schiffer. I presented my findings <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/SIRF_2017_Poster.pdf">through a poster {download here}</a> and also helped present a more general poster <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/IWM_2017.pdf">at the 2017 International C. elegans meeting in Los Angeles {download here}</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I worked with a new undergraduate student in the lab, Abby Volegaar, and we presented our work at the <a href="https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/RISE_2017.pdf">2017 Research Innovation and Scholarship Expo {Download poster here}</a></p>
