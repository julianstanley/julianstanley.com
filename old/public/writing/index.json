        "body": " Introduction to GeneInfo As part of Interdisciplinary Advanced Writing in Summer 2019, I created an educational website about genomics.\nMy aim with the site was to target well-educated, English-speaking adults with an interest in their health. I wanted to educate a broad audience of adults who may be interested in their genomic health due to the rise of clinical and direct-to-consumer testing, but for whom clinical educational materials (which are generally capped at a sixth-grade reading level) felt lacking.\nThe fully rendered website can be accessed at geneinfo.julianstanley.com, but I’ve included the text of that website below as well, for easier reference.\n::: {#main} - Overview - Genome? - Clinical Tests - DTC Testing - Safety \u0026amp; Privacy - Wrapping up \u0026amp; Resources\nWelcome to Gene Info! This is a website about understanding your genomic data in an era of data encryption, huge healthcare data, and consumer testing companies like 23andMe.\nI hope that this webpage is informational and can help you better understand how your genome data affects your life, and how it is kept safe. This short project was developed as a writing assignment for Northeastern University’s Interdiscplinary Advanced Writing course in Summer 2019.\n  \n What is my genome? In short: your genome is just a collection of all of your genes, the chemical instructions that your body uses to grow and live.\nMore specifically, your genome is a chemical found at the center of each of your body’s millions of cells. Your genome is mostly made of the compound called DNA, which itself is made of a long string of four smaller chemicals, called DNA “bases”, which we abbreviate ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’, and ‘G’. (1,2) Most of your DNA is inherited—half from your biological mother and half from your biological father.\nDNA is like a recipe book that your cells use to keep you alive. The genetic recipe book is huge: if you printed all of the ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’, and ‘G’ letters, it would be over 500 times larger than Proust’s a la recherche du temps perdu, the longest novel written. Your cells use DNA recipes to make proteins, the microscopic machines that keep your body up-and-running. (3)\nCells never use all their DNA. Instead, they choose which DNA recipes to make. For example, while muscle and brain cells have the same DNA copy, they make different proteins to perform their different roles.\nDNA affects your health, but it’s not the only player. You may have heard about “nature v.s. nurture” in determining traits like blood pressure or personality. Most traits are affected by both genes and the environment. (4) For example, people have different types of the gene that makes insulin, the protein that digests sugars. Because of these genetic differences, people can be more or less likely be overweight or develop diabetes. That’s a nature part. But nurture still matters: someone who eats a dozen donuts for breakfast daily will be at higher risk for diabetes, regardless of their genetics.\nThe DNA letters stand for the chemicals Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine. ↩\n Technically, DNA is made up of smaller chemicals called nucleotides. Nucleotides have three parts, one of which is the DNA base. Since you can tell nucleotides apart by looking at their base (A, T, C, or G), we use those letters to identify them. ↩\n Literally! For example, some proteins have designs that look just like modern motors. These structures are so astounding and complex that they have historically been used to argue against the well-established model of evolution. ↩\n In fact, there are whole fields of study where traits are given actual numbers to describe how much of that trait comes from genes and how much is from the environment.. ↩\n     \n Clinical Genomic Testing Since DNA can affect your health, hospitals and doctors will sometimes order DNA tests in addition to more traditional medical tests.\nThere are different types of genetic tests that might be ordered by a doctor. For example, if parents have a family history of a genetic disease like sickle-cell anemia or Tay-Sachs disease, they might have a specific genetic test that checks whether they are likely to give that disease to their children.\nFetuses themselves are often tested as well, both for specific genes (which can cause diseases like cystic fibrosis) and for large changes in chromosomes (1) that can cause diseases like Down Syndrome.\nClinical tests can also be important for diagnosis of susceptibility to certain diseases. This includes testing for the BRCA1/2 genes, which can indicate how likely a patient is to develop a certain types of ovarian and breast cancers. After positve susceptibility testing, some patients may decide to take proactive measures. 2\nImportantly, most clinical genomic testing is looks for something very specific. In contrast, newer technologies, like sequencing the entire genome or all the DNA that makes proteins, can be used without any particular disease or gene in mind. While these tests can reveal secondary findings, such as the terrifying prospect of accidentally uncovering an incurable genetic disease, there is some promise for such exploratory tests to reveal new insights into complicated traits such as cardiovascular health.\nGenetic screening in infants is generally performed through a procedure called amniocentesis. ↩\n Angelina Jolie famously undertook a double mastectomy in 2013 after discovering that she carried the BRCA1 gene. ↩\n     \n Direct to Consumer (DTC) Tests Companies like 23andMe, Veritas, Color, and Ancestry market at-home genetic testing directly to consumers.\nThey work by either sequencing your whole genome or sequencing around one million base pairs in your genome (array-based sequencing).\nLet’s start with array-based sequencing. The average person has around 3 billion DNA bases, but only less than 1% of those bases (around 20 million) vary, on average. If you just sequence about a million DNA bases, you can learn some things about health, and a good few things about ancestry.\nAncestry and 23andMe all use array-based sequencing to predict where your ancestors came from. Their ancestry predictions are based on their database of genetic information–so they are usually much more accurate for people of European descent.\n23andMe and Color use array-based sequencing to predict health traits. Until last year, none of these tests were FDA approved. Then, 23andMe approval for tests for a handful of genes, including the BRCA1 cancer genes. Still, their results are still not diagnostic, and should not be used to make any medical choices. (1)\nCompanies like Veritas offer whole-genome sequencing for health purposes, and require a doctor’s order. (2). Instead of just sequencing around one million genetic variants, they sequence the entire, 3-billion base-pair genome, for somewhere between $200 and $1000. Veritas argues that whole-genome sequencing can reveal health (and ancestry) insights that array-based sequencing cannot, but the industry is still poorly regulated and cannot diagnose disease.\nOverall: at this point in time, DTC genomic tests should be treated as a novelty. Their ancestry tests are not always accurate, and their health tests have limited uses, and can often cause unnecessary panic.\nThis is because, for example, BRCA1 does cause cancer, just slightly increases your chances, and having a normal BRCA1 gene does not significantly change your risk for cancer overall. Part of the reason why 23andMe has gotten FDA approval is because their educational material is fantastic (although, some argue that consumers still misinterpret genetic data, since it takes a lot of time and effort to read educational material). For example, you might want to take a look at their BRCA info page. ↩\n Companies like Veritas have attracted scrutiny for having a network of doctors who are willing to order genetic tests for essentially anyone who wants them. ↩\n     \n How is my genomic data kept safe? Commercial companies share customer data, but usually on an opt-in basis. ~80% of 23andMe customers agree to let their data be shared for research.\nOther companies let people upload their genomes to find relatives. One example is GEDmatch , which was important in resolving the Golden State Killer case.\nWebsites like GEDmatch are possible because DNA is very similar between relatives. So, even if your DNA has not been sequenced, you can be identified via your relatives.\nGenetic data can be used to discriminate against employees. For example, in 2002 a railroad company forced its employees to undergo a genetic test. They faced disciplinary action but, if genomic data was public, they may have been able to discriminate without attracting as much attention. (1)\nSo, how liable is your genomic data to becoming public?\nGenome testing companies and hospitals encrypt (2) identifying information before sharing data. They then decide whether or not identifying information can be re-accessed with a password (3).\nBut, even with encryption, genomic data can be re-identified with some effort. And, as we saw with the GEDmatch example, your distant relatives genomes can be used to identify you.\nFurther, hackers don’t need to reveal whole genomes. For example, when James Watson released his DNA in 2008, he chose to keep the APOE gene–which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease–private. But, based on statistical models, (4) it was relatively straightforward to infer his APOE genotype from his other genes.\nThe take-away is: whenever you submit your DNA to a company or a hospital, ask about their data privacy practices. Even if small amounts of your DNA sequence are released, it could reveal private aspects of your health and the health of your relatives to individuals and organizations that could discriminate against you on the basis of that information.\nThe U.S. has the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act that bars health insurance companies for discriminating based on genetics, but does not apply to life insurance or employers. ↩\n Encryption is just the process of making secret messages. When you were growing up, you may have written secret messages to your friends, and that was a form of encryption. You may have told your friend that letters would be shifted–e.g. “A” actually meant “B”, “B” meant “C”, etc. So the message “Hello” would have been written “Gdkkn”. That is encryption, but mathematicians and computer scientists have developed a lot of sophisticated techniques to make encryption harder to crack than a simple cipher. I think that most articles online about encryption are overly complicated–if you want to read more, I recommend that you start with this simple Wikipedia page to get the idea, and then take a look at the RSA encryption algorithm, which a common modern technique. ↩\n This is a pretty dense topic, but it’s absolutely worth getting into, if you have time. This open-access academic paper is a great resource, if you’re interested. ↩\n These models are called imputation, and they’re really common in research. It lets researchers use small amounts of genetic testing to reconstruct most of the genome (remember, 99.9% of our genes are identical, so it’s not as monumental of a task as it may seem). ↩\n     \n Wrapping Up Why does this matter, again? Here’s a quick summary of what you learned on this website:\nYour genome is the chemical code that determines how your body develops and works on a day-to-day basis. Hospitals and doctors can determine the sequence of your genome to help determine your susceptibility to certain diseases. Direct-to-consumer companies like 23andMe will also sequence your genome, but those services cannot tell you much about your health, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Whether you get your genome sequenced by a doctor or by a company, your personal data will likely be stored in an encrypted database which, if hacked, could make you at risk for data-based discrimination. It is likely wise to be aware of how your data is stored and kept safe.  \nThanks for reading! If you’re still hungry for more information, here are some bonus resources:\n What is consumer genetics?

        "body": " Introduction I completed this interdisciplinary research proposal after two weeks of collaboration with a classmate (Khailah Griffin) in Summer 2019.\nOur goal was to use her knowledge of business and computer security and my knowledge of genomics and biology to create a proposal to address concerns about the security and privacy of large genomic databases. The full text is pasted below.\nStandardizing Data Security in a Genomic Era\nKhailah Griffin and Julian Stanley\nInterdisciplinary Advanced Writing, Northeastern University\nJune 02, 2019\n Abstract From whole genome sequencing to 23andMe, healthcare and medicine are increasingly supplemented by large amounts of genomic data. This relatively recent phenomenon has prompted concerns about personal data security. While experts have made great strides in securing sensitive datasets in the last decade, there remains a great deal of work to be done. In particular, health data security is poorly standardized\u000b— different healthcare organizations including hospitals use different standards to secure their data. Here, we briefly review the history of genomics in medicine, and how large amounts of genomic data have the potential to make medicine cheaper and more effective. Then we discuss the security risks associated with genomic data, and how those risks are addressed by different organizations. We conclude that the standardization of health data security practices, alongside regulation and oversight, are necessary to ensure that recent genomics breakthroughs can be used without compromising sensitive patient data.\nWhat's the Problem?\nData in healthcare is not new. For decades, physicians and hospitals have collected data on their patients' weights, heights, diets, and the results of biochemical tests such as blood sugars and cell counts. In the 21st century, healthcare data has quickly grown even larger. In 2011, healthcare data exceeded 150 trillion megabytes and included medical imaging, annotation, administrative data, and even personal data such as Facebook feeds and Twitter updates (Raghupathi 2014, pg 1). Of particular note is the recent expansion of medically-relevant genomic data, both from clinical genomics tests and from direct-to-consumer tests such as 23andMe. Medical databases added approximately 500 billion megabytes of genomic sequencing data in 2014 alone, and the popularity of genomic testing is growing rapidly each year (Phillips\n2014, pg. 1248).\nAs hospitals store increasingly large amounts of patient data on private and public servers, healthcare data security becomes even more important. As of 2017 there were reportedly over 450 healthcare data breaches in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Office for Civil Rights, 2019). As data becomes more prevalent in our healthcare operations, the risks increase in regards to the safety and protection of securing all patient information. One major concern is the re-identification of anonymized data (Malin 2004). For example, a patient could consent to a study on the premise that none of their personal health data could be publically traced back to their identity. A physician may perform an analysis and then publish the data onto a public database without any names, ages, or other identifying information, so that others can replicate their analysis. While this anonymization may be sufficient to meet professional standards, relatively simple computational algorithms can often reverse engineer the data and identify many of the study participants. While modern techniques can often thawart de-anonymization attempts (El Emam 2011), the threat still exists for certain types of genomic traits, as has been demonstrated using data from 23andMe (Humbert 2015).\nIn the subsequent sections, we aim to frame and enumerate an argument for the standardization of healthcare data security. First, we explore the factors leading to the recent increase in the popularity of genomic medicine. We argue that genomic data, and the concerns associated with its storage, will continue to grow in the coming decades. Then, we discuss the techniques that are currently used to secure genomic data, including data anonymization and protecting genomic databases from hacking. We observe that modern techniques used to secure genomic data are effective but, if implemented incorrectly, can be bypassed or abused. We also note that the increasing sophistication of data manipulation is alarming and must be matched with even more sophisticated security methods. We suggest that further research and policy efforts be directed not towards the methods by which genomic data is secured, but towards an appropriate way to standardize and enforce data security standards across multiple organizations and industries.\nHow Has Genomics Changed Healthcare?\nGenome sequencing technologies have existed since the 1970s, but have just begun make their way into the clinic. In 1977, Frederick Sanger and colleagues developed a low-throughput DNA sequencing technique that is still today the most accurate method available. Sanger sequencing was used to complete the decoding of the first human genome in 2001 at a cost of over $3 billion. Just three years later, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies enabled the recreation of the human genome more inexpensively and in less time. Today, a full human genome can be sequenced for around $1000, a three million-fold reduction in cost from 2001 (Kumar 2016, pg. 15).\nAs whole-genome sequencing has become cheaper, the field of “genomics” has emerged as an offshoot of classical genetics. While classical geneticists might look at the effect of one or a handful of genes on a disease with a clear genetic component, genome scientists look at the genome as a whole. For example, they may conduct genome-wide association studies, where they look for correlations between genomic regions and disease in large populations. These studies can lead to polygenic risk scores, where certain combinations of genes are associated with an increased risk of complex traits, such as cardiovascular health. To improve these scores further, genomics is often combined with environmental data. As Dr. Kathryn Phillips explains in a recent genomics commentary, “health care systems are hoping to reap the benefits of big data by combining patients' genomic data with clinical, behavioral, and environmental data to facilitate the use of more-tailored treatments and to examine patterns of associations across patients” (Phillips 2014).\nWhy is Genomic Data Important?\nFields of study that use genomic data to help patients are rapidly expanding. For example, microarrays and whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing are being used to predict the sensitivity of patients to certain drugs. For example, when EGFR is amplified in advanced lung cancer, it can predict how well a patient responds to gevininib and gefitinib, cancer immunotherapy drugs (Wang 2010). The broader field of predicting drug responses based on genomic information, called pharmacogenomics or sometimes ‘personalized’ or ‘precision’ medicine', has shown a great deal of promise. Patients whose genome sequencing reveals a certain variant in the P450 gene do not metabolize the hypertension drug debrisoquine. For those patients (between 1-10% of the U.S. population, depending on ethnicity), knowledge of their genome could save them from life-threatening hypertension and thousands of dollars in wasted prescription fees (Brown 2008, pg. 227). A recently-established pharmacogenomic database, as of 2019, has collected nearly 4000 annotations based on drug-genome interactions and has synthesized those annotations into over 100 clinical guidelines (Brown 2008, pg. 228 and pharmgkb.org). As we accumulate more genomic data from patients taking different medications, we will continue to learn about drug-genome interactions that will make drugs more effective for more patients, ultimately saving thousands of lives.\nBeyond precision medicine, genomic data can also be useful for detecting illness and providing diagnoses. In research, whole-genome studies have been used to develop polygenic risk scores for complex diseases such as major depressive disorder and cardiovascular health (De Moor 2015, Kong 2015). The results from these studies might be synthesized into diagnostic markers that can be identified through simpler methods, such as SNP arrays. However, some clinically-significant genomic characteristics are best identified through clinical whole genome sequencing. For example, diagnosis of Long QT Syndrome and a variety of congenital anomalies have been shown to be effective through analysis of whole-genome data (Stavropoulos 2015, Priest 2014).\n Direct-to-Consumer Testing Adds a Layer of Complexity In parallel to clinical genomics testing, companies such as 23andMe and Veritas Genetics have offered “clinical-grade” genomics direct-to-consumer (DTC) consumer tests that include single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and whole-genome sequencing. These tests generally offer low clinical utility, since many of the genes reported by DTC tests have no known interventions (e.g. Huntington's disease-related genes), with the notable exception of a few mutations, such as those in the BRCA2 gene associated with breast cancer.\nDTC consumer tests may uncover unexpected genetic variants and, if released publically, that data could negatively affect a patient. Regardless of the actual clinical utility of DTC test results, they could be used by insurance companies or employers to discriminate between patients. Further, data may be more liable to public release by DTC companies, as such companies may be more prone to accidental data loss and can also release data for commercial purposes (Brown 2008, pg. 349-352). While genomics is transforming the health care landscape, the distribution of genomic data between different health care providers and private companies may jeopardize patient safety and security.\nHow Do We Secure Genomic Data?\nSince genomic data will likely continue to grow, it is highly imperative that it be secured properly. There are numerous examples of the potential consequences of genomic data being accessed without patient consent. In one high profile example in April, 2018, the “Golden State Killer” was found after decades of lost hope by the police. It was documented that the use of his genetic data was compromised and this allowed police to track him down. In this case, the use of genomic data was helpful, but it raised a question of how our genomic data is being used, who can access it, and how easy is it to manipulate our personal information (Washington Post, 2018). Anonymizing data is crucial to the protection of patients, doctors, and anyone related to the healthcare forum. As researchers use more genomic datasets in their studies, it is evident that it is difficult to ensure the privacy of a person's genomic data while also sharing that data with collaborators and the scientific public. Due to this, many identity-protective solutions have been proposed to tackle data privacy and minimize public concern (Malin 2004).\nAs of the present day, there are several successful identity-protective methods implemented by a vast majority of healthcare and research organizations. Cryptography and encryption methods play a prominent and vital role in the progression towards a more standardized approach to securing genomic data. The main concern in genomic protection is a hacker's ability to reverse engineer anonymization techniques and thereby access a patient's confidential genomic data (Malin, 2004). With more advanced approaches like cryptography and encryption, it is harder if not impossible to expose confidential information without being granted user access. Hospitals are implementing these methods into their patient data domains to solidify safety and assure that genomic data is being secured.\n Encryption Methods “A basic task in cryptography is to enable users to communicate securely over an insecure channel in a way that guarantees their transmissions' privacy and authenticity” (Coron, 2006). Cryptography is extremely common in healthcare since it allows professionals to transfer information amongst themselves but effectively prevents third parties from manipulating, hacking, or seeing what data is being transmitted. Cryptography relies on the notion that a coded system should secure any dataset. Encryption is one practical subset of cryptography used by many healthcare industries to protect patients' genomic data. It allows the coding and accessibility to become more specific in terms of security and lower the probability of decoding abilities to unauthorized users.\nWhile engineers have been studying the science behind security for years, more recently the encryption method has become extremely relevant. This is the ability to secure private information including genomic data, and allow only a certain party to hold access to the information. This method has been more successful than simple anonymization because it resolves the re-identification issue. “A growing number of studies demonstrate that deidentied data can be reidentied…As an alternative, it was shown that biomedical data could be shared, managed, and analyzed through practical cryptographic protocols” (Canim, 2012). ** **\nEncryption allows healthcare professionals to maintain confidential information while still being able to access the data they need to design research. Encryption is common in healthcare and different types of encryption offer different balances between speed and security. Security experts argue that techniques based on homomorphic encryption are often the most versatile and secure (Mittos 2019, Kim 2015), but no there are no legally-explicit standards. While modern encryption methods generally ensure that outside parties are not able to decrypt, retrace, and re-identify the genomic data, regulations are needed to ensure that modern and vetted techniques are used in all medical databases. Without the encryption of datasets, all of our information can be compromised (Lauter, 2015).\n Regulations According to the National Institute of Health, “Part of having an information security mindset is being aware of the multiple dimensions of access control and accountability at all times” (NIH, 2015). With the rise of ambiguity in genomics, several protocols have been iteratively adjusted to ensure that procedures align with the promise to protect genomic data. “NIH controlled-access genomic and phenotypic data are kept secure and no one other than users approved by NIH is able to access the data” (NIH, 2015). Without strict regulations, patients, or any person related to a patient, are at risk of exposure of their personal information and/or genomic data. With this comes a possibility of non-consent testings, genetic compromisation, effects of care/treatment, and several other dangerous events. \"Anonymity was assumed when data was stripped of explicit identifying information, such as personal name or Social Security\nNumber…such methods do not guarantee the anonymity of health data, including genomic data\"\n(Malin 2004). This is a point of concern for professionals, policy makers, and the general public.\nIn addition to the general concern of personal exposure, the release of genomic data may also lead to data-based discrimination. If a patient's records are no longer confidential to access-granted parties, one can be liable to several changes including the tampering of insurance rates. In 2008, in response to concerns about genomic discrimination, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was made into law. “GINA provides a baseline level of protection against genetic discrimination for all Americans” (Department of Health and Human Services 2009). Regulations like GINA are vital to our safety so that in the possible case our genomic data is breached, American citizens are protected—outsiders cannot use genomic data against you in any way shape of form. If laws like this are not in place, there comes the potential of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, financial status, etc. For example, the compromisation of genomic data can inform insurance providers if your genetic makeup is “good or bad.” In doing this, insurance companies can decide whether or not to exclude you, raise your cost of insurance, etc. With regulations such as GINA, people are protected from this kind or any type of discrimination (The Economist, 2017). The ever-increasing uses and risks of genetic data necessitates that policy makers make great efforts to regulating safe protective precautions for patients and their families.\n Conclusion The impact and use of genomic data is a critical part of the progression towards a more efficient healthcare providing society. To ensure that our genomic data is properly secured, healthcare organizations must consistently use modern encryption methods. To ensure that the secured genomic data is protected, policymakers must keep pace with the rapid changes in genomics and continue enacting laws and guidelines that protect us from any type of manipulation, exposure, or discrimination. Without this, unauthorized third parties can access our personal information without our knowledge or consent. The use of genomic data has progressed the healthcare industry and has saved lives of thousands. Genomic technologies show great promise for healthcare, but without proper regulation and data securities, they have the power to do more harm than good.\n References Aranha, Diego F., and Alfred Menezes. \"Progress in Cryptology – LATINCRYPT 2014:\nThird International Conference on Cryptology and Information Security in Latin\nAmerica Florianópolis, Brazil, September 17-19, 2014 Revised Selected Papers.\"\nLecture Notes in Computer Science (Including Subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)\u000b, vol. 8895, 2015, pp. 3–27, doi:10.1007/978-3-319-16295-9.\nBeam, Andrew L., and Isaac S.

While healthcare changes in response to genetic knowledge has come more slowly than many hoped, it has come nonetheless. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the Human Genome Project, scientists can now connect changes in human genes with things like diseases, ancestry, and clinical predispositions to conditions like obesity. A single human genome consists of around 3 billion base pairs, represented as letters, but physicians and scientists will collect even more information about different chemical tags that change the way that genes are turned into proteins, in addition to traditional information like demographics and medical history. The collection and study of information about genes and things that influence genes is commonly called genomics. The influx of genome data has created a whole new field of applying cryptography methods including encryption to databases that house genomic information. A decade ago, genomic security measures were not nearly as nuanced and advanced as they are today, despite many advanced techniques being available. Today, the field has progressed to a point where genomic security is developed and taken very seriously. With the advancement of technology also comes the advancement of hacker abilities. As we transition into a data-run society, policymakers, engineers, and healthcare professionals must stay abreast to the challenges, new security breach techniques, and informative notions that allow us to secure our information. With this being such a young field, there is plenty of recent literature discussing how to develop organizational and policy-level changes to keep up to date with the quickly-changing technical landscape.\n Glossary Anonymization: A type of data processing that protects the source of a dataset, usually for subject privacy. Generally, any technique that removes any data that could identify the source from which the data came.\nBiochemical tests: Measurements of enzymes or proteins that are generally conducted in a medical laboratory. For example, a test that measures blood sugar\u000b. \nCancer immunotherapy drugs: Therapeutic chemicals that try to use the body's immune system to remove cancerous tumors.\nCongenital abnormality: A medical condition, often inherited, that appears before birth. Cryptography: The science or study of the techniques of secret writing, especially code and cipher systems, methods, and the like.\nDebrisoquine: A common drug for high blood pressure.\nDirect-to-consumer tests: A common term referring to medical tests that are advertised to patients, rather than doctors and hospitals.\nEGFR (gene):\u000bThe gene that encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which is important for growth and development.\nEncryption: to\u000bencipher\u000bor\u000bencode\u000b.\nGefitinib: An epidermal growth factor inhibitor often used for the treatment of certain cancers. _ _ Genome-wide association studies: Scientific studies that use expectation-based statistical tests to determine whether a gene or certain genes are associated with certain traits or diseases.\nGenomic data: The sequence of nucleotides that make up the genetic sequence and the epigenetic data that controls the translation of genes into proteins.\nHomomorphic encryption: An extension of public-key cryptography that allows for the decoding of an encrypted message without access to the original cipher.\nMicroarrays or SNP arrays: Approximately smartphone-sized microchips that detect the presence of a collection (usually a few hundred thousand to a million) of genetic variants. Next-generation sequencing: The use of massively parallel, automated biochemical processes to sequence large amounts of genomic information.\nP450 (gene): The gene encoding the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes which, among other functions, synthesize and breakdown important hormones.\nPartially homomorphic encryption: Refers to a collection of algorithms (such as Unpadded RAA, Benaloh, etc.\u000b) that often are more computationally efficient than fully homomorphic encryption, but are often less secure.\nPharmacogenomics: The use of genomic information to inform drug response and efficacy. Polygenic risk scores: Collections of gene-weight pairs that are used to predict a patient's risk of a disease, given their genetic information.\nSanger sequencing: One of the first methods to sequence genetic information that is highly accurate, but very slow compared to next-generation sequencing.\nWhole-genome sequencing: Recording the base pairs that make up an entire genome, as opposed to microarray profiling (detecting certain genes), or whole-genome sequencing (recording only protein-encoding genes). ** **\n "
