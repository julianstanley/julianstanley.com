How do you study for a preliminary exam? I don't know, I was hoping you could tell me.

I'll write something insightful up here at some point. For now, just trying to make a daily log of what I've been doing. 


## Daily Log

### Monday, 1 August 2022

I want to focus on a few things:

* Write my project proposal
* Better understand and revise my project proposal
* Map between my proposal and common techniques / ways of thinking from 1st year course material
* Record my progress each day
