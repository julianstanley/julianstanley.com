How do you study for a preliminary exam? I don't know, I was hoping you could tell me.

I might write something insightful up here at some point. For now, just trying to make a daily log of what I've been doing. 


## Daily Log

### Monday, 1 August 2022

I want to focus on a few things over the course of this study period:

* Write my project proposal
* Better understand and revise my project proposal
* Map between my proposal and common techniques / ways of thinking from 1st year course material
* Record my progress each day 


#### Progress for today:

1. Start to write a messy version of the preliminary exam proposal


#### Reading(s) for today:

1. [Nikolic 2022, BMC Research Notes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13104-022-06061-9)

**Summary:** Used a fluorescent reporter +/- ACA sequences and +/- a leader under expression of mazF. 

**Relevance to project:** They use a "leaderless" construct, but they don't specify the promoter (native GFP promoter?) or show a 5' start, but that may have been shown in reference paper (Oron-Gottesman 2016, will read next). In both plasmids, they are not able to see expression of leaderless GFP over background, except in the high-copy-number-plasmid after 6h mazF induction. So, their lmRNA GFP is not highly expressed.

**Relevant data points:**

1. Their "leaderless" GFP is expressed at the same level as no-reporter, whereas canonical GFP is ~40-fold in exponential phase. 

**Figure summary:**

Figure 1 shows GFP (under leaderless or canonical mRNA, both without ACA sequences) after induction of mazF. In a high copy plasmid, there's clear increase in GFP concentration compared to no-plasmid control. 

Figure 2 shows that the amount of increase of flourescence after mazF induction is lower for mCherry (with ACA) than GFP (without ACA)
