<p>A leaderless GFP mRNA, has 17 out-of-frame ACA sites that don’t interfere with expression after mazF induction. Adding an ACA site in the ORF prevented expression.</p>

<p>Really not impressed by the quality control in this paper. E.g., it sites Fig S1 about the effect of nalidixic acid on their reporter, but S1 has nothing to do with nalidixic acid–that’s S2. &amp; Their “OD600” axis is in the hundreds–is it OD * 100?</p>

<p>Basically we’re seeing that induction of mazF <em>reduces</em> the GFP level in constructs with in-frame ACA sites. There’s no difference in a mazEF knockout, and it <em>increases</em> GFP level in WT and when you add an AC before the start codon (they call this leaderless due to cleavage, but don’t show that).</p>

<p>They make an argument that only in-frame ACA sites are cleaved, substantiating their claim by comparing PCR band intensities.</p>

<p>Then they find that their GFP-up/down phenotype +/- mazF induction can be reserved by making a mutation to the EDF-like sequence in bS1.</p>

<p>They conclude that there may be a bias away from ACAs being in frame, to protect from mazF cleavage.</p>

<p>I’m not convinced by this paper–the figures are not very clean, there are not multiple veins of evidence for each conclusion. It highlights that I really need to make sure I can think critically about the techniques raised in the controversy over the formation of stress-induced translation machinery, should also read <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00825-19">Wade 2019</a> and the response <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.01063-19">Nigam 2019</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21944167/">Vesper 2011</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276518303484">Culviner 2018</a>.</p>

<p>Take a $\Delta$mazF strain, put mazF on an ara-inducible promoter, low-copy plasmid. Induce mazF for just 5 minutes, take paired-end sequencing reads, and look for regions where density decreases. Confirm patterns with single-gene RT-qPCR.</p>

<p>82% of genes were highly-cleaved (2-fold or more downregulated, compared to empty vector) after mazF induction.</p>

<p>They also compare this to 5’-OH sequencing, but that’s not well-correlated–likely because of different 5’-end stabilities.</p>

<p>Not all ACAs are cleaved at the same rate, so they took some sequence logos and think that there’s a ~7-nt region.</p>

<p>They confirmed that these flanking sequences are important by selecting some of them across different RNA-seq scores, taking them out of context into a reporter, and then qPCR quantifying them, and that correlated as-expected.</p>

<p>They find a few genes that, by this method, may be leaderless after mazF induction (just 41). They measure ribosome footprints for all genes, and find that none of those leaderless genes have any substantial increase in footprints.</p>

<p>To put the nail in the coffin, they added an ACA site between the RBS and start codon of YFP, and did not see any increase in flourescence after mazF induction.</p>

<p>They also saw traffic jams of ribosomes upstream of identified cleavage sites.</p>

<p>I want to focus on a few things over the course of this study period:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write my project proposal</li>
  <li>Better understand and revise my project proposal</li>
  <li>Map between my proposal and common techniques / ways of thinking from 1st year course material</li>
  <li>Record my progress each day</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="progress-for-today-1">Progress for today:</h4>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Used a fluorescent reporter +/- ACA sequences and +/- a leader under expression of mazF.</p>

<p><strong>Relevance to project:</strong> They use a “leaderless” construct, but they don’t specify the promoter (native GFP promoter?) or show a 5’ start, but that may have been shown in reference paper (Oron-Gottesman 2016, will read next). In both plasmids, they are not able to see expression of leaderless GFP over background, except in the high-copy-number-plasmid after 6h mazF induction. So, their lmRNA GFP is not highly expressed.</p>

<p><strong>Relevant data points:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Their “leaderless” GFP is expressed at the same level as no-reporter, whereas canonical GFP is ~40-fold in exponential phase.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Figure summary:</strong></p>

<p>Figure 1 shows GFP (under leaderless or canonical mRNA, both without ACA sequences) after induction of mazF. In a high copy plasmid, there’s clear increase in GFP concentration compared to no-plasmid control.</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows that the amount of increase of flourescence after mazF induction is lower for mCherry (with ACA) than GFP (without ACA)</p>
