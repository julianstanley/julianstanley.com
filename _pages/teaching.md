## Fall 2020 - Summer 2021 
No teaching during this period (busy with starting my PhD!). I'll resume TAing in Fall 2021.

## Summer 2020

###  Molecular Biology: DNA Replication & Repair (7.28.1x-7.28.3x)

This was an online, community TA position for MITxbio. I had a great time teaching (and learning among) students from all over the world in the discussion forums.

## Spring 2020

### Bioinformatics Computational Methods 2 (BINF6309)

This was a TA position for a core graduate bioinformatics class. I managed the online materials (deploying through GitHub and GitBook) and wrote a few dozen pages of materials about basic bioinformatics algorithms. I was also invited to give a guest lecture on clustering and distance metrics (unexpectedly, my lecture was the last in-person lecture before we went virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

## Fall 2019

### Bioinformatics Computational Methods 1 (BINF6308)

This was a TA position for a core graduate bioinformatics class. I helped Dr. Chuck Roesel transition the curriculum onto a online textbook hosted on GitBook.

## Spring 2017-Summer 2019
No teaching


## Fall 2016

### Laboratory for Genetics and Molecular Biology (BIOL2302, Northeastern University)
This was a curriculum development project. I wrote some modules with background, exercises, etc. for Northeastern's undergraduate genetics lab.

## Summer 2016
### Techniques in Biology (BIOL2309, Northeastern University)
This was a teaching-assistant (TA) position for a small (~12) laboratory course. I think the course is now called Biology Project Laboratory. It was super practical, teaching to pipette, do PCR, etc. I also got to help students develop independent mini-projects.


## Spring 2016
### Laboratory for General Chemistry I (CHEM 1217, Northeastern University)
This was a curriculum development project. It was a lot of fun, I was part of a small team that re-developed our introductory chemistry lab to be project-oriented and incorporate elements from research being conducted on-campus.
