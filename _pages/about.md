My research interests are still developing. Generally, I'm interested in building models for how microorganisms adapt to different environments. 

I think that research should be entirely reproducible. So, I am trying to hold myself accountable by having detailed methods for every paper that I write. Additionally, I also try to have a GitHub repository for each project for additional resources and source code.
