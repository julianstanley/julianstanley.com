        "body": "Today I upgraded the base 256 GB SSD (2.5 mm) on my Thinkpad T460 to a 1 TB Samsung 860 EVO.\nIt took me a few google searches to learn how to make the transition. In the end, I used Tuxboot to make a bootable Clonezilla USB drive, and then GParted to resize my partition. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I did step-by-step:\n Connect your new SSD via USB. I used a StarTech cable from Amazon. Download Tuxboot (from the SourceForce Repo). Extract and install Tuxboot.  I needed to run apt-get install libqt4-dev, apt-get install mtools, and then ./INSTALL.  Run sudo ./tuxboot to run the tuxboot GUI. On the first line, select \u0026ldquo;On-Line Distribution\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;clonezilla_live_stable\u0026rdquo;, connect an empty USB drive, select that drive on the last line, and click \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo;. After tuxboot makes a bootable clonezilla USB, boot from that USB. Follow the disk-to-disk clone tutorial from on the Clonezilla website. After restarting, download Gparted with sudo apt-get gparted. Follow the instructions in the GUI to resize the new disk to the full ~950 GB. Physically install the new SSD, and you should be good to go!  "
