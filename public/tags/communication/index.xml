      <description>Science is notoriously poorly communicated. I was recently browsing the DePace Lab Website and it linked me to a fantastic video called “Teaching Matters” by Professor Andrew Murray.
My interest in science communication is nothing new, but the video nonetheless made me think twice about how I’m presenting my research. Not only does science need to be communicated to the public (who funds most university research) but it also needs to be better communicated to other scientists, especially those who may benefit from the research but who are in tangential fields with different jargon.</description>
