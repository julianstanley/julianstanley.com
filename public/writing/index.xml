      <description>Introduction to GeneInfo As part of Interdisciplinary Advanced Writing in Summer 2019, I created an educational website about genomics.

      <description>Introduction I completed this interdisciplinary research proposal after two weeks of collaboration with a classmate (Khailah Griffin) in Summer 2019.
Our goal was to use her knowledge of business and computer security and my knowledge of genomics and biology to create a proposal to address concerns about the security and privacy of large genomic databases. The full text is pasted below.
