      <description>Introduction to GeneInfo As part of Interdisciplinary Advanced Writing in Summer 2019, I created an educational website about genomics.
My aim with the site was to target well-educated, English-speaking adults with an interest in genetics. I wanted to educate a broad audience of adults who may be interested in their genomci health due to the rise of clinical and direct-to-consumer testing, but for whom clinical educational materials (which are generally capped at a sixth-grade reading level) felt lacking.</description>

Abstract From whole genome sequencing to 23andMe, healthcare and medicine are increasingly supplemented by large amounts of genomic data. This relatively recent phenomenon has prompted concerns about personal data security. While experts have made great strides in securing sensitive datasets in the last decade, there remains a great deal of work to be done.</description>
