Hi, I'm Julian. I'm a researcher in Bioinformatics and Genetics with 2 years of full-time experience. I'll graduate with a B.S. in Biology in June 2019 and an M.S. in Bioinformatics in May 2020 from Northeastern University.

I like studying the genetics and molecular biology of living things. Increasingly, that field involves more and more computation and, with the increased ability to model processes iteratively, the systems-level approach to molecular biology seems really promising. So I'm working on building and using bioinformatics and computational biology tools and models so that I can learn more new things about how life works.

[Here is my CV, if you want to take a look. {Download} ](https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/CV_2019.pdf). I'll be applying to PhD programs soon.


Please peruse the site! It's a work in progress, but I hope you like it. See you around!
