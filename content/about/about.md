Hi, I'm Julian. I'm a young researcher and I'll graduate with a B.S. in Biology in June 2019 and an M.S. in Bioinformatics in may 2020 from Northeastern University.

I would like to study the genetics and molecular biology of living things. Increasingly, that field involves more and more computation and, with the increased ability to model processes iteratively, the systems-level approach to molecular biology seems really promising. So I'm working on building and using bioinformatics and computational biology tools and models so that I can learn more new things about how life works.

[Here is my CV, if you want to take a look. ](https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/tree/master/content/resources/CV_2019.pdf). I'll be applying to PhD programs soon.

Please peruse the site! It's a work in progress, but I hope you like it. See you around!
