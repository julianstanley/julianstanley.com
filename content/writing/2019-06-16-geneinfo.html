<h1>Introduction to GeneInfo</h1>
<p>As part of Interdisciplinary Advanced Writing in Summer 2019, I created an educational website about genomics.</p>
<p>My aim with the site was to target well-educated, English-speaking adults with an interest in genetics. I wanted to educate a broad audience of adults who may be interested in their genomci health due to the rise of clinical and direct-to-consumer testing, but for whom clinical educational materials (which are generally capped at a sixth-grade reading level) felt lacking.</p>
<p>The fully rendered website can be accessed at
<a href="https://geneinfo.julianstanley.com">geneinfo.julianstanley.com</a>, but I’ve included the text of that website below as well, for easier reference.</p>

<p>This is a website about understanding your genomic data in an era of
data encryption, huge healthcare data, and consumer testing companies
like 23andMe.</p>
<p>I hope that this webpage is informational and can help you better
understand how your genome data affects your life, and how it is kept
safe. This short project was developed as a writing assignment for
<a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/writing/advanced-writing-in-the-disciplines/">Northeastern University’s Interdiscplinary Advanced

<h1 id="what-is-my-genome">What is my genome?</h1>
<p>In short: your
<a href="https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-a-genome">genome</a> is just a
collection of all of your genes, the chemical instructions that your
body uses to grow and live.</p>
<p>More specifically, your genome is a <em>chemical</em> found at the center of
each of your body’s millions of cells. Your genome is mostly made of the
compound called DNA, which itself is made of a long string of four
smaller chemicals, called DNA “bases”, which we abbreviate ‘A’, ‘T’,
‘C’, and ‘G’. (<sup><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>,<sup><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>) Most of
your DNA is inherited—half from your biological mother and half from
your biological father.</p>
<p>DNA is like a recipe book that your cells use to keep you alive. The
genetic recipe book is huge: if you printed all of the ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘C’,
and ‘G’ letters, it would be over <a href="https://www.veritasgenetics.com/our-thinking/whole-story">500 times
larger</a> than
Proust’s <em>a la recherche du temps perdu</em>, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/teach/live-lessons/5-fascinating-book-facts/zbrdy9q">longest novel
written</a>.
Your cells use DNA recipes to make proteins, the microscopic machines
that keep your body up-and-running. (<sup><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Cells never use all their DNA. Instead, they choose which DNA recipes to
make. For example, while muscle and brain cells have the same DNA copy,
they make different proteins to perform their different roles.</p>
<p>DNA affects your health, but it’s not the only player. You may have
heard about “nature v.s. nurture” in determining traits like blood
pressure or personality. Most traits are affected by <strong>both</strong> genes and
the environment. (<sup><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>) For example, people have
different types of the gene that makes insulin, the protein that digests
sugars. Because of these genetic differences, people can be more or less
likely be overweight or develop diabetes. That’s a nature part. But
nurture still matters: someone who eats a dozen donuts for breakfast
daily will be at higher risk for diabetes, regardless of their genetics.</p>

<p>Technically, DNA is made up of smaller chemicals called nucleotides.
Nucleotides have three parts, one of which is the DNA base. Since

<h1 id="clinical-genomic-testing">Clinical Genomic Testing</h1>
<p>Since DNA can affect your health, hospitals and doctors will sometimes
order DNA tests in addition to more traditional medical tests.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/gtesting/genetic_testing.htm">different types of genetic
tests</a> that
might be ordered by a doctor. For example, if parents have a family
history of a genetic disease like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/facts.html">sickle-cell
anemia</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tay-sachs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20378190">Tay-Sachs
disease</a>,
they might have a specific genetic test that checks whether they are
likely to give that disease to their children.</p>
<p>Fetuses themselves are often tested as well, both for specific genes
(which can cause diseases like cystic fibrosis) and for large changes in
chromosomes (<sup><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">1</a></sup>) that can cause diseases like Down
Syndrome.</p>
<p>Clinical tests can also be important for diagnosis of <em>susceptibility</em>
to certain diseases. This includes testing for the BRCA1/2 genes, which
can indicate how likely a patient is to develop a certain types of
ovarian and breast cancers. After positve susceptibility testing, some
patients may decide to take proactive measures. <sup><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Importantly, most clinical genomic testing is looks for something very
specific. In contrast, newer technologies, like sequencing the entire
genome or <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/sequencing">all the DNA that makes
proteins</a>, can be
used without any particular disease or gene in mind. While these tests
can reveal <a href="https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/testing/secondaryfindings">secondary
findings</a>,
such as the terrifying prospect of <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/081029/full/4551155a.html">accidentally uncovering an incurable
genetic
disease</a>,
there is some promise for such exploratory tests to reveal new insights
into complicated traits such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/8/24/17759772/genetics-polygenic-risk-heart-disease-nature">cardiovascular
health</a>.</p>

<h1 id="direct-to-consumer-dtc-tests">Direct to Consumer (DTC) Tests</h1>
<p>Companies like 23andMe, Veritas, Color, and Ancestry market at-home
genetic testing directly to consumers.</p>
<p>They work by either sequencing your whole genome or sequencing around
one million base pairs in your genome (array-based sequencing).</p>
<p>Let’s start with array-based sequencing. The average person has around 3
billion DNA bases, but only less than 1% of those bases (around 20
million) vary, on average. If you just sequence about a million DNA
bases, you can learn some things about health, and a good few things
about ancestry.</p>
<p>Ancestry and 23andMe all use array-based sequencing to predict where
your ancestors came from. Their ancestry predictions are based on their
database of genetic information–so they are usually much more accurate
for people of European descent.</p>
<p>23andMe and Color use array-based sequencing to predict health traits.
Until last year, none of these tests were FDA approved. Then, 23andMe
approval for tests for a handful of genes, including the BRCA1 cancer
genes. Still, their results are still not diagnostic, and should not be
used to make any medical choices. (<sup><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">1</a></sup>)</p>
<p>Companies like Veritas offer whole-genome sequencing for health
purposes, and require a doctor’s order. (<sup><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">2</a></sup>).
Instead of just sequencing around one million genetic variants, they
sequence the entire, 3-billion base-pair genome, for somewhere between
$200 and $1000. Veritas argues that whole-genome sequencing can reveal
health (and ancestry) insights that array-based sequencing cannot, but
the industry is still poorly regulated and cannot diagnose disease.</p>
<p>Overall: at this point in time, DTC genomic tests should be treated as a
novelty. Their ancestry tests are not always accurate, and their health
tests have limited uses, and can often cause unnecessary panic.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><div id="fn:7">
<p>This is because, for example, BRCA1 does cause cancer, just slightly
increases your chances, and having a normal BRCA1 gene does not
significantly change your risk for cancer overall. Part of the
reason why 23andMe has gotten FDA approval is because their
educational material is fantastic (although, some argue that
consumers still misinterpret genetic data, since it takes a lot of
time and effort to read educational material). For example, you
might want to take a look at their <a href="https://www.23andme.com/brca">BRCA info
page</a>. <a href="#fnref:7" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
</div></li>
<li><div id="fn:8">
<p>Companies like Veritas have attracted scrutiny for having a network
of doctors who are willing to order genetic tests for essentially
<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/03/16/genetic-tests-fda-regulation/">anyone who wants
them</a>. <a href="#fnref:8" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

<h1 id="how-is-my-genomic-data-kept-safe">How is my genomic data kept safe?</h1>
<p>Commercial companies share customer data, but usually on an opt-in
basis. ~<a href="https://mediacenter.23andme.com/company/about-us/">80%</a> of
23andMe customers agree to let their data be shared for research.</p>
<p>Other companies let people upload their genomes to find relatives. One
example is <a href="https://www.gedmatch.com/">GEDmatch</a> , which was important
in resolving the <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/we-will-find-you-dna-search-used-nab-golden-state-killer-can-home-about-60-white">Golden State
Killer</a>
case.</p>
<p>Websites like GEDmatch are possible because DNA is very similar between
relatives. So, even if your DNA has not been sequenced, you can be
identified via your relatives.</p>
<p>Genetic data can be used to discriminate against employees. For example,
in 2002 a railroad company forced its employees to undergo a genetic
test. They <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/5-8-02.cfm">faced disciplinary
action</a> but, if
genomic data was public, they may have been able to discriminate without
attracting as much attention. (<sup><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">1</a></sup>)</p>
<p>So, how liable is your genomic data to becoming public?</p>
<p>Genome testing companies and hospitals encrypt
(<sup><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">2</a></sup>) identifying information before sharing data.
They then decide whether or not identifying information can be
re-accessed with a password (<sup><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">3</a></sup>).</p>
<p>But, even with encryption, genomic data can be re-identified with some
effort. And, as we saw with the GEDmatch example, your distant relatives
genomes can be used to identify you.</p>
<p>Further, hackers don’t need to reveal whole genomes. For example, when
James Watson released his DNA in 2008, he chose to keep the APOE
gene–which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease–private. But, based
on statistical models, (<sup><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">4</a></sup>) it was relatively
straightforward to infer his APOE genotype from his other genes.</p>
<p>The take-away is: whenever you submit your DNA to a company or a
hospital, ask about their data privacy practices. Even if small amounts
of your DNA sequence are released, it could reveal private aspects of
your health and the health of your relatives to individuals and
organizations that could discriminate against you on the basis of that
information.</p>

<p>Encryption is just the process of making secret messages. When you
were growing up, you may have written secret messages to your
friends, and that was a form of encryption. You may have told your
friend that letters would be shifted–e.g. “A” actually meant “B”,
“B” meant “C”, etc. So the message “Hello” would have been written
“Gdkkn”. That <em>is</em> encryption, but mathematicians and computer
scientists have developed a lot of sophisticated techniques to make
encryption harder to crack than a simple cipher. I think that most
articles online about encryption are overly complicated–if you want
to read more, I recommend that you start with <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">this simple Wikipedia

<p>Why does this matter, again? Here’s a quick summary of what you learned
on this website:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Your genome is the chemical code that determines how your body
develops and works on a day-to-day basis.</li>
<li>Hospitals and doctors can determine the sequence of your genome to
help determine your susceptibility to certain diseases.</li>
<li>Direct-to-consumer companies like 23andMe will also sequence your
genome, but those services cannot tell you much about your health,
and should be taken with a grain of salt.</li>
<li>Whether you get your genome sequenced by a doctor or by a company,
your personal data will likely be stored in an encrypted database
which, if hacked, could make you at risk for data-based
discrimination. It is likely wise to be aware of how your data is
stored and kept safe.</li>
