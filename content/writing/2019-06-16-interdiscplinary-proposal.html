<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>From whole genome sequencing to 23andMe, healthcare and medicine are increasingly supplemented by large amounts of genomic data. This relatively recent phenomenon has prompted concerns about personal data security. While experts have made great strides in securing sensitive datasets in the last decade, there remains a great deal of work to be done. In particular, health data security is poorly standardized <strong>—</strong> different healthcare organizations including hospitals use different standards to secure their data. Here, we briefly review the history of genomics in medicine, and how large amounts of genomic data have the potential to make medicine cheaper and more effective. Then we discuss the security risks associated with genomic data, and how those risks are addressed by different organizations. We conclude that the standardization of health data security practices, alongside regulation and oversight, are necessary to ensure that recent genomics breakthroughs can be used without compromising sensitive patient data.</p>
<p><strong>What's the Problem?</strong></p>
<p>Data in healthcare is not new. For decades, physicians and hospitals have collected data on their patients' weights, heights, diets, and the results of biochemical tests such as blood sugars and cell counts. In the 21st century, healthcare data has quickly grown even larger. In 2011, healthcare data exceeded 150 trillion megabytes and included medical imaging, annotation, administrative data, and even personal data such as Facebook feeds and Twitter updates (Raghupathi 2014, pg 1). Of particular note is the recent expansion of medically-relevant genomic data, both from clinical genomics tests and from direct-to-consumer tests such as 23andMe. Medical databases added approximately 500 billion megabytes of genomic sequencing data in 2014 alone, and the popularity of genomic testing is growing rapidly each year (Phillips</p>
<p>2014, pg. 1248).</p>
<p>As hospitals store increasingly large amounts of patient data on private and public servers, healthcare data security becomes even more important. As of 2017 there were reportedly over 450 healthcare data breaches in the United States (U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Office for Civil Rights, 2019). As data becomes more prevalent in our healthcare operations, the risks increase in regards to the safety and protection of securing all patient information. One major concern is the re-identification of anonymized data (Malin 2004). For example, a patient could consent to a study on the premise that none of their personal health data could be publically traced back to their identity. A physician may perform an analysis and then publish the data onto a public database without any names, ages, or other identifying information, so that others can replicate their analysis. While this anonymization may be sufficient to meet professional standards, relatively simple computational algorithms can often reverse engineer the data and identify many of the study participants. While modern techniques can often thawart de-anonymization attempts (El Emam 2011), the threat still exists for certain types of genomic traits, as has been demonstrated using data from 23andMe (Humbert 2015).</p>
<p>In the subsequent sections, we aim to frame and enumerate an argument for the standardization of healthcare data security. First, we explore the factors leading to the recent increase in the popularity of genomic medicine. We argue that genomic data, and the concerns associated with its storage, will continue to grow in the coming decades. Then, we discuss the techniques that are currently used to secure genomic data, including data anonymization and protecting genomic databases from hacking. We observe that modern techniques used to secure genomic data are effective but, if implemented incorrectly, can be bypassed or abused. We also note that the increasing sophistication of data manipulation is alarming and must be matched with even more sophisticated security methods. We suggest that further research and policy efforts be directed not towards the methods by which genomic data is secured, but towards an appropriate way to standardize and enforce data security standards across multiple organizations and industries.</p>
<p><strong>How Has Genomics Changed Healthcare?</strong></p>
<p>Genome sequencing technologies have existed since the 1970s, but have just begun make their way into the clinic. In 1977, Frederick Sanger and colleagues developed a low-throughput DNA sequencing technique that is still today the most accurate method available. Sanger sequencing was used to complete the decoding of the first human genome in 2001 at a cost of over $3 billion. Just three years later, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies enabled the recreation of the human genome more inexpensively and in less time. Today, a full human genome can be sequenced for around $1000, a three million-fold reduction in cost from 2001 (Kumar 2016, pg. 15).</p>
<p>As whole-genome sequencing has become cheaper, the field of “genomics” has emerged as an offshoot of classical genetics. While classical geneticists might look at the effect of one or a handful of genes on a disease with a clear genetic component, genome scientists look at the genome as a whole. For example, they may conduct genome-wide association studies, where they look for correlations between genomic regions and disease in large populations. These studies can lead to polygenic risk scores, where certain combinations of genes are associated with an increased risk of complex traits, such as cardiovascular health. To improve these scores further, genomics is often combined with environmental data. As Dr. Kathryn Phillips explains in a recent genomics commentary, “health care systems are hoping to reap the benefits of big data by combining patients' genomic data with clinical, behavioral, and environmental data to facilitate the use of more-tailored treatments and to examine patterns of associations across patients” (Phillips 2014).</p>
<p><strong>Why is Genomic Data Important?</strong></p>
<p>Fields of study that use genomic data to help patients are rapidly expanding. For example, microarrays and whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing are being used to predict the sensitivity of patients to certain drugs. For example, when EGFR is amplified in advanced lung cancer, it can predict how well a patient responds to gevininib and gefitinib, cancer immunotherapy drugs (Wang 2010). The broader field of predicting drug responses based on genomic information, called pharmacogenomics or sometimes ‘personalized’ or ‘precision’ medicine', has shown a great deal of promise. Patients whose genome sequencing reveals a certain variant in the P450 gene do not metabolize the hypertension drug debrisoquine. For those patients (between 1-10% of the U.S. population, depending on ethnicity), knowledge of their genome could save them from life-threatening hypertension and thousands of dollars in wasted prescription fees (Brown 2008, pg. 227). A recently-established pharmacogenomic database, as of 2019, has collected nearly 4000 annotations based on drug-genome interactions and has synthesized those annotations into over 100 clinical guidelines (Brown 2008, pg. 228 and pharmgkb.org). As we accumulate more genomic data from patients taking different medications, we will continue to learn about drug-genome interactions that will make drugs more effective for more patients, ultimately saving thousands of lives.</p>
<p>Beyond precision medicine, genomic data can also be useful for detecting illness and providing diagnoses. In research, whole-genome studies have been used to develop polygenic risk scores for complex diseases such as major depressive disorder and cardiovascular health (De Moor 2015, Kong 2015). The results from these studies might be synthesized into diagnostic markers that can be identified through simpler methods, such as SNP arrays. However, some clinically-significant genomic characteristics are best identified through clinical whole genome sequencing. For example, diagnosis of Long QT Syndrome and a variety of congenital anomalies have been shown to be effective through analysis of whole-genome data (Stavropoulos 2015, Priest 2014).</p>

<div id="direct-to-consumer-testing-adds-a-layer-of-complexity" class="section level1">
<h1>Direct-to-Consumer Testing Adds a Layer of Complexity</h1>
<p>In parallel to clinical genomics testing, companies such as 23andMe and Veritas Genetics have offered “clinical-grade” genomics direct-to-consumer (DTC) consumer tests that include single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and whole-genome sequencing. These tests generally offer low clinical utility, since many of the genes reported by DTC tests have no known interventions (e.g. Huntington's disease-related genes), with the notable exception of a few mutations, such as those in the BRCA2 gene associated with breast cancer.</p>
<p>DTC consumer tests may uncover unexpected genetic variants and, if released publically, that data could negatively affect a patient. Regardless of the actual clinical utility of DTC test results, they could be used by insurance companies or employers to discriminate between patients. Further, data may be more liable to public release by DTC companies, as such companies may be more prone to accidental data loss and can also release data for commercial purposes (Brown 2008, pg. 349-352). While genomics is transforming the health care landscape, the distribution of genomic data between different health care providers and private companies may jeopardize patient safety and security.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Secure Genomic Data?</strong></p>
<p>Since genomic data will likely continue to grow, it is highly imperative that it be secured properly. There are numerous examples of the potential consequences of genomic data being accessed without patient consent. In one high profile example in April, 2018, the “Golden State Killer” was found after decades of lost hope by the police. It was documented that the use of his genetic data was compromised and this allowed police to track him down. In this case, the use of genomic data was helpful, but it raised a question of how our genomic data is being used, who can access it, and how easy is it to manipulate our personal information (Washington Post, 2018). Anonymizing data is crucial to the protection of patients, doctors, and anyone related to the healthcare forum. As researchers use more genomic datasets in their studies, it is evident that it is difficult to ensure the privacy of a person's genomic data while also sharing that data with collaborators and the scientific public. Due to this, many identity-protective solutions have been proposed to tackle data privacy and minimize public concern (Malin 2004).</p>
<p>As of the present day, there are several successful identity-protective methods implemented by a vast majority of healthcare and research organizations. Cryptography and encryption methods play a prominent and vital role in the progression towards a more standardized approach to securing genomic data. The main concern in genomic protection is a hacker's ability to reverse engineer anonymization techniques and thereby access a patient's confidential genomic data (Malin, 2004). With more advanced approaches like cryptography and encryption, it is harder if not impossible to expose confidential information without being granted user access. Hospitals are implementing these methods into their patient data domains to solidify safety and assure that genomic data is being secured.</p>
</div>
<div id="encryption-methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Encryption Methods</h1>
<p>“A basic task in cryptography is to enable users to communicate securely over an insecure channel in a way that guarantees their transmissions' privacy and authenticity” (Coron, 2006). Cryptography is extremely common in healthcare since it allows professionals to transfer information amongst themselves but effectively prevents third parties from manipulating, hacking, or seeing what data is being transmitted. Cryptography relies on the notion that a coded system should secure any dataset. Encryption is one practical subset of cryptography used by many healthcare industries to protect patients' genomic data. It allows the coding and accessibility to become more specific in terms of security and lower the probability of decoding abilities to unauthorized users.</p>
<p>While engineers have been studying the science behind security for years, more recently the encryption method has become extremely relevant. This is the ability to secure private information including genomic data, and allow only a certain party to hold access to the information. This method has been more successful than simple anonymization because it resolves the re-identification issue. “A growing number of studies demonstrate that deidentied data can be reidentied…As an alternative, it was shown that biomedical data could be shared, managed, and analyzed through practical cryptographic protocols” (Canim, 2012). ** **</p>
<p>Encryption allows healthcare professionals to maintain confidential information while still being able to access the data they need to design research. Encryption is common in healthcare and different types of encryption offer different balances between speed and security. Security experts argue that techniques based on homomorphic encryption are often the most versatile and secure (Mittos 2019, Kim 2015), but no there are no legally-explicit standards. While modern encryption methods generally ensure that outside parties are not able to decrypt, retrace, and re-identify the genomic data, regulations are needed to ensure that modern and vetted techniques are used in all medical databases. Without the encryption of datasets, all of our information can be compromised (Lauter, 2015).</p>
</div>
<div id="regulations" class="section level1">
<h1>Regulations</h1>
<p>According to the National Institute of Health, “Part of having an information security mindset is being aware of the multiple dimensions of access control and accountability at all times” (NIH, 2015). With the rise of ambiguity in genomics, several protocols have been iteratively adjusted to ensure that procedures align with the promise to protect genomic data. “NIH controlled-access genomic and phenotypic data are kept secure and no one other than users approved by NIH is able to access the data” (NIH, 2015). Without strict regulations, patients, or any person related to a patient, are at risk of exposure of their personal information and/or genomic data. With this comes a possibility of non-consent testings, genetic compromisation, effects of care/treatment, and several other dangerous events. &quot;Anonymity was assumed when data was stripped of explicit identifying information, such as personal name or Social Security</p>
<p>Number…such methods do not guarantee the anonymity of health data, including genomic data&quot;</p>
<p>(Malin 2004). This is a point of concern for professionals, policy makers, and the general public.</p>
<p>In addition to the general concern of personal exposure, the release of genomic data may also lead to data-based discrimination. If a patient's records are no longer confidential to access-granted parties, one can be liable to several changes including the tampering of insurance rates. In 2008, in response to concerns about genomic discrimination, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was made into law. “GINA provides a baseline level of protection against genetic discrimination for all Americans” (Department of Health and Human Services 2009). Regulations like GINA are vital to our safety so that in the possible case our genomic data is breached, American citizens are protected—outsiders cannot use genomic data against you in any way shape of form. If laws like this are not in place, there comes the potential of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, financial status, etc. For example, the compromisation of genomic data can inform insurance providers if your genetic makeup is “good or bad.” In doing this, insurance companies can decide whether or not to exclude you, raise your cost of insurance, etc. With regulations such as GINA, people are protected from this kind or any type of discrimination (The Economist, 2017). The ever-increasing uses and risks of genetic data necessitates that policy makers make great efforts to regulating safe protective precautions for patients and their families.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The impact and use of genomic data is a critical part of the progression towards a more efficient healthcare providing society. To ensure that our genomic data is properly secured, healthcare organizations must consistently use modern encryption methods. To ensure that the secured genomic data is protected, policymakers must keep pace with the rapid changes in genomics and continue enacting laws and guidelines that protect us from any type of manipulation, exposure, or discrimination. Without this, unauthorized third parties can access our personal information without our knowledge or consent. The use of genomic data has progressed the healthcare industry and has saved lives of thousands. Genomic technologies show great promise for healthcare, but without proper regulation and data securities, they have the power to do more harm than good.</p>

<h1>Context memo</h1>
<p>In 2001, the Human Genome Project was completed with the promise that knowledge of human genetics would revolutionize the study of human disease. While healthcare changes in response to genetic knowledge has come more slowly than many hoped, it has come nonetheless. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the Human Genome Project, scientists can now connect changes in human genes with things like diseases, ancestry, and clinical predispositions to conditions like obesity. A single human genome consists of around 3 billion base pairs, represented as letters, but physicians and scientists will collect even more information about different chemical tags that change the way that genes are turned into proteins, in addition to traditional information like demographics and medical history. The collection and study of information about genes and things that influence genes is commonly called genomics. The influx of genome data has created a whole new field of applying cryptography methods including encryption to databases that house genomic information. A decade ago, genomic security measures were not nearly as nuanced and advanced as they are today, despite many advanced techniques being available. Today, the field has progressed to a point where genomic security is developed and taken very seriously. With the advancement of technology also comes the advancement of hacker abilities. As we transition into a data-run society, policymakers, engineers, and healthcare professionals must stay abreast to the challenges, new security breach techniques, and informative notions that allow us to secure our information. With this being such a young field, there is plenty of recent literature discussing how to develop organizational and policy-level changes to keep up to date with the quickly-changing technical landscape.</p>

<h1>Glossary</h1>
<p><strong>Anonymization:</strong> A type of data processing that protects the source of a dataset, usually for subject privacy. Generally, any technique that removes any data that could identify the source from which the data came.</p>
<p><strong>Biochemical tests:</strong> Measurements of enzymes or proteins that are generally conducted in a medical laboratory. For example, a test that measures blood sugar<em>. </em></p>
<p><strong>Cancer immunotherapy drugs:</strong>  Therapeutic chemicals that try to use the body's immune system to remove cancerous tumors.</p>
<p><strong>Congenital abnormality:</strong> A medical condition, often inherited, that appears before birth. <em>Cryptography:</em> The science or study of the techniques of secret writing, especially code and cipher systems, methods, and the like.</p>
<p><strong>Debrisoquine:</strong> A common drug for high blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Direct-to-consumer tests:</strong>  A common term referring to medical tests that are advertised to patients, rather than doctors and hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>EGFR (gene):</strong>The gene that encodes the epidermal growth factor receptor, which is important for growth and development.</p>
<p><strong>Encryption:</strong> to<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/encipher">encipher</a> or<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/encode">encode</a><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/encode">.</a></p>
<p><strong>Gefitinib:</strong>  An epidermal growth factor inhibitor often used for the treatment of certain cancers. _ _ <strong>Genome-wide association studies:</strong>  Scientific studies that use expectation-based statistical tests to determine whether a gene or certain genes are associated with certain traits or diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Genomic data:</strong> The sequence of nucleotides that make up the genetic sequence and the epigenetic data that controls the translation of genes into proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Homomorphic encryption:</strong>  An extension of public-key cryptography that allows for the decoding of an encrypted message without access to the original cipher.</p>
<p><strong>Microarrays or SNP arrays:</strong> Approximately smartphone-sized microchips that detect the presence of a collection (usually a few hundred thousand to a million) of genetic variants. <strong>Next-generation sequencing:</strong> The use of massively parallel, automated biochemical processes to sequence large amounts of genomic information.</p>
<p><strong>P450 (gene):</strong> The gene encoding the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes which, among other functions, synthesize and breakdown important hormones.</p>
<p><strong>Partially homomorphic encryption:</strong> Refers to a collection of algorithms (such as Unpadded RAA, Benaloh, <em>etc.</em>) that often are more computationally efficient than fully homomorphic encryption, but are often less secure.</p>
<p><strong>Pharmacogenomics:</strong>  The use of genomic information to inform drug response and efficacy. <strong>Polygenic risk scores:</strong> Collections of gene-weight pairs that are used to predict a patient's risk of a disease, given their genetic information.</p>
<p><strong>Sanger sequencing:</strong> One of the first methods to sequence genetic information that is highly accurate, but very slow compared to next-generation sequencing.</p>
<p><strong>Whole-genome sequencing:</strong> Recording the base pairs that make up an entire genome, as opposed to microarray profiling (detecting certain genes), or whole-genome sequencing (recording only protein-encoding genes). ** **</p>
