# Introduction

[Click here](https://github.com/julianstanley/julianstanley.com/raw/master/content/resources/SIRF_2019.pdf)
to view my project proposal for the 2019 Scholars Independent Research Fellowship.

I used the 2019 fellowship to improve accessibility of my mathematical model for comparing the relative suitability of
real-time biosensors. For more information, see the [SensorOverlord](https://sensoroverlord.org) website,
or the [SensorOverlord GitHub repository](https://github.com/julianstanley/sensorOverlord).
